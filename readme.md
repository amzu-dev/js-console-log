# console.log example
This is an example project in Node JS that uses Node, ExpressJS to demonstrate the console object's various methods that can be used in the code to help debug.

Note that many methods work beautiful in browser console, so can be used effectively in a frontend frameworks like React or Vue.

Happy Coding :-)
